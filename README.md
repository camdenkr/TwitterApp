# TwitterApp
MATLAB Twitter "messaging" app


Designed using the Twitter API. The app functions so that two people can communicate using twitter accounts and uncommon keywords.
The app grabs and filters twitter messages using keywords, thereby anybody messaging on twitter with a tweet that contains the keyword
will appear. If the token is kept secret, it allows for private messaging within the app itself.

The app can also be used as a simple Twitter search app.
